        The main ingredients found in all (maki rolls) sushi are the seaweed, short grain rice and of course the soysauce and wasabi to go with it.
        From there you can add all sorts of ingredients. For example, the California roll has cucumber, imitation crab and avocado. 
        You will also find all sort of raw (or cooked) fish on your rolls. Other ingredients are: breaded crab, mango, cream cheese, fish eggs... and so on.
        For this recipe, we will be making a california roll.
